## About

A subtle window-resize based parallax effect created for a real website as secret feature. I don't think the effect can be used widely – but if you like it, feel free to copy the source and create something nice of it. Just for inspiration: The original website also featured some animated birds in GIF images within the Parallax.

## How to use

1. Open the website in a browser that supports CSS transitions.
2. Make sure to view it in wide viewport - like `1920×1080px` - or zoom out to see the full animation.
3. Resize the window slowly (lets say about `50-100px` per step) and wait a little bit – `like 1 sec.` – after each step. The parallax animation will slowly follow the resize direction.

The animation will only start if the window is smaller than `1900px` but wider than `1000px`. This is to keep the footer element always in the center (see screenshot).
