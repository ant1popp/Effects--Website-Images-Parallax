## About
A subtle window-resize based parallax effect I created for a website concept as a hidden gimmick.
(The real version also had a few GIF-animations with birds in the trees and the sky)

I don't think the effect can be used widely - but if you like it,
feel free to copy the source and create something nice of it. (I would really like to any result)


<br><br>
## Todo
- The first resize does not look good, it quickly jumps... maybe a problem of using CSS transitions?


<br><br>
## How to use
Download all files and open in a new browser (Firefox or Chrome).
You need a big display to see the full animation because of the big images; preferably about 1920Ã—1080px.

Resize the window slowly (lets say about 50-100px per step) and wait a little bit - like 1 sec. - after each step.
The parallax animation will slowly follow the resize direction.

Animation will only start if you the window is smaller than 1900px but wider than 1000px.
This is to keep the footer element always in the center (see screenshot).

#### Requirements
- Any modern browser with CSS transition support
- Last tested with: Firefox 34 and Chrome 39 under Win 7
