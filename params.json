(I would really like to any result)\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n## Todo\r\n- The first resize does not look good, it quickly jumps... maybe a problem of using CSS transitions?\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n## How to use\r\nDownload all files and open in a new browser (Firefox or Chrome).\r\nYou need a big display to see the full animation because of the big images; preferably about 1920Ã—1080px.\r\n\r\nResize the window slowly (lets say about 50-100px per step) and wait a little bit - like 1 sec. - after each step.\r\nThe parallax animation will slowly follow the resize direction.\r\n\r\nAnimation will only start if you the window is smaller than 1900px but wider than 1000px.\r\nThis is to keep the footer element always in the center (see screenshot).\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n- Any modern browser with CSS transition support\r\n- Last tested with: Firefox 34 and Chrome 39 under Win 7\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n## Preview\r\n![Screenshot](/Screenshots/Website-Demo.png)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
